Research on VPN Encryption and Privacy Features (Proton VPN):

I used Proton VPN, which is known for its strong privacy policies and secure encryption standards.

Encryption:

Proton VPN uses AES-256 encryption, one of the most secure standards used worldwide, even by militaries and banks. This means all my internet traffic is encrypted so that no one — not even hackers or my Internet Service Provider (ISP) — can read my data.

It also uses Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), which changes encryption keys regularly to ensure past sessions can't be decrypted, even if a future key is compromised.

Protocols:

Proton VPN supports multiple secure VPN protocols:

OpenVPN (UDP/TCP) – A widely trusted and secure protocol.

WireGuard – A newer, lightweight protocol that provides high speed with strong encryption.

IKEv2/IPSec – Used especially for mobile devices.

Here I used Wireguard protocol during the connection.

Privacy Features:

No-logs policy: Proton VPN does not store logs of user activity, ensuring privacy.

Kill switch: Automatically cuts off internet access if the VPN connection drops, preventing data leaks.

DNS leak protection: Prevents your DNS queries from being exposed.

Tor over VPN: Lets you access the Tor network with an extra layer of encryption.

Secure Core (Optional): Routes traffic through multiple servers (multi-hop) in privacy-respecting countries.

Conclusion:

Proton VPN provides a high level of privacy, security, and anonymity using advanced encryption techniques, strict no-log policies, and strong privacy features. It’s especially useful for securely browsing the internet, avoiding surveillance, and protecting data over public Wi-Fi.

VPN Benefits and Limitations:
 
Benefits of Using a VPN:

1. Privacy Protection:

  Hides your IP address and location.Prevents websites, ISPs, and trackers from monitoring your online activity.

2. Encrypted Internet Traffic:

   Uses strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) to protect data.Secure even on public Wi-Fi (like in cafes or airports).


3. Bypass Geo-Restrictions:

   Access content or websites blocked in your country (e.g., region-locked videos or apps).


4. Avoid Censorship:

   Helps access blocked websites in restrictive regions (like news, social media, etc.).


5. Safe Torrenting:

   Protects your identity when downloading files via P2P networks (if allowed by the VPN).

Limitations of Using a VPN:

1. Reduced Internet Speed:

   VPN can slow down your connection due to encryption and rerouting through distant servers.

2. Not Complete Anonymity:

   A VPN hides your IP, but if you log in to your personal accounts (like Gmail, Facebook), those sites can still track you.

3. Limited Free Plans:

   Proton VPN's free tier has fewer server locations and may be slower during high traffic.

4. May Not Bypass All Blocks:

   Some services (like Netflix or banking websites) may block VPN traffic or require verification.

5. Requires Trust in VPN Provider:

   You must trust that the VPN provider (even Proton) really follows its no-log policy.

6. Device Compatibility:
    
   Some devices (like Smart TVs or gaming consoles) require extra setup to use VPNs.
